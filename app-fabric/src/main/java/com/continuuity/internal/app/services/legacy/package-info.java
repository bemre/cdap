 *   In order to minimize changes on the front end side by moving back-end to newer API, specifically in the code
 *   that fetches and uses serialized (JSON) objects of older API we want to return objects of old API to the fronted.
 *   Hence old API objects are brought to the new App Fabric codebase in this package.
